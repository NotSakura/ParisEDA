# ParisEDA


This paper has a very in-depth step-by-step analysis of trying to play around with the Airbnb data for Paris, France, found at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.

The process itself was replicated from the textbook Telling Stories with Data by Rohan Alexander (https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/)

- The main repository contains all the elements. `ParisEDA.qmd` is the quarto file with the code while `ParisEDA` is the pdf format of that. `references.bib` stores all the references.
